    """The BlazeFace face detection model from MediaPipe.
    
    The version from MediaPipe is simpler than the one in the paper; 
    it does not use the "double" BlazeBlocks.

    Because we won't be training this model, it doesn't need to have
    batchnorm layers. These have already been "folded" into the conv 
    weights by TFLite.

    The conversion to PyTorch is fairly straightforward, but there are 
    some small differences between TFLite and PyTorch in how they handle
    padding on conv layers with stride 2.

    This version works on batches, while the MediaPipe version can only
    handle a single image at a time.

    Based on code from https://github.com/tkat0/PyTorch_BlazeFace/ and
    https://github.com/hollance/BlazeFace-PyTorch and
    https://github.com/google/mediapipe/
